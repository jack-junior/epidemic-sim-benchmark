# Epidemic Simulation Benchmark

Research code for comparing an Esper Entity Component System epidemic model
with a Mesa agent-based implementation.

This is an independent exploration of whether a data-oriented ECS architecture
can express a nontrivial spatial epidemic model and provide a useful basis for
a controlled comparison with a conventional object-oriented agent-based model.

## Current Status

The ECS prototype is implemented and runnable. The Mesa model and the
cross-implementation benchmark are planned work and are not runnable yet.

The project currently demonstrates:

- Mobile agents in a bounded two-dimensional space
- Spatial transmission based on distance and susceptibility
- Weighted contact-network transmission
- Random and spatial-age homophily networks
- Dynamic network rewiring
- Infection-hazard accumulation and resolution
- Disease progression, recovery, and death
- Optional quarantine with mobility and transmission effects
- Reproducible, model-owned random streams
- Temporal and spatial result collection

## Layout

- `src/epidemic_sim/ecs`: implemented Esper model, components, and systems
- `src/epidemic_sim/mesa`: Mesa implementation area
- `src/epidemic_sim/networks`: shared network utilities
- `src/epidemic_sim/data`: data-related package code
- `src/epidemic_sim/analysis`: library analysis and visualization utilities
- `scripts`: executable ECS and data-generation scripts, plus planned Mesa and benchmark entry points
- `experiments`: benchmark, profiling, and parity experiment code
- `data`: raw, processed, and generated datasets
- `results` and `project_outputs`: generated artifacts

## Installation

The project uses uv for environment and dependency management:

```bash
uv sync
uv run python -c "from epidemic_sim.ecs.simulation import SIREpidemicModel; print('Package import: OK')"
```

## Running the ECS Model

Run the implemented ECS simulation with:

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_ecs.py
```

The runner uses a 1,000-agent illustrative configuration and saves generated
figures in the current working directory. To keep outputs together, run it
from `project_outputs`:

```bash
cd project_outputs
uv run python ../scripts/run_ecs.py
```

The ECS workflow produces epidemic curves, a spatial-agent animation, a spatial
heatmap, and an infected-density 3D wave using the `viridis` colormap.

Example visual outputs:

![Spatial agent animation](project_outputs/spatial_animation.gif)

![Infected density wave](project_outputs/infected_density_wave.gif)

The synthetic-data script expects its source CSV files under `data/raw`:

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_data.py
```

The synthetic-data workflow additionally requires SDV, which is kept outside
the core dependencies because its current releases do not resolve for Python
3.12.

## ECS vs Mesa Benchmark

Run the benchmark experiments from the repository root:

```bash
uv run python -m experiments.benchmark_runner parity --replicates 100 --n-agents 300
uv run python -m experiments.benchmark_runner profile --n-agents 1000 --steps 50
```

See [experiments/README.md](experiments/README.md) for options and quick-run
instructions. The Mesa model is also available through `scripts/run_mesa.py`.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, especially in these areas:

- Implementing the Mesa parity model
- Validating ECS and Mesa state-transition equivalence
- Designing reproducible benchmark experiments
- Profiling runtime and memory scaling
- Adding tests for seeded reproducibility and world isolation
- Implementing extensions such as vaccination or new health compartments
- Improving documentation and scientific reproducibility

Please keep comparisons fair: ECS and Mesa implementations should use the same
parameters, mechanisms, output definitions, and comparable algorithms.
